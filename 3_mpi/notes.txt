Work has been split between each process

2 Halo exchanges: 1 right after move_particles, 1 right after update_cells

update_cells also updates 1 row above and below (the ghost rows) its working set of rows.
This is because they may contain particles in their cells that are moving into the processes
Working set of rows. This way those particles can be included in the calculations after moving
Outside of the previous processes working space.

Had to modify the cell_list struct so the particles array is always length 10 instead of dynamic.
This makes the halo exchange easier as it will send the same number of bytes each time, rather
than a varying number of bytes if the particles list was dynamic. Obviously this brings the issue
of the program not working if more than 10 particles are ever in a cell at the same time, but with
the default settings of 500x500 with a seed of 1, this does not happen and I have not had this happen
on any other seed so far.
This modified cell_list struct also made the add_particle and remove_particles functions significantly
simpler.
